## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this project, I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I've created in a past project - WeatherPy. Specifically, I'll be plotting cities.csv.

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also created a home  page - "Landing Page," a page for the purpose of seeing a comparison of all of the plots, and another page for the purpose of viewing the data used to build them.

The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A home page ("Landing Page") containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. I have provided a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A description the plot and its significance.
* A Comparison page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so the user can easily visually compare them.
* A Data page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The website also, at the top of every page, has a navigation menu that allows the user to easily navigate to each of the above-mentioned pages. The website is also responsive in its design, accommodating many different device screen sizes.
